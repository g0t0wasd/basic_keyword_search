Questions
1. How much time did you spend and what was the most time-consuming part?

	4-5 hours. Mostly on makeup (harder to work without existing layout) + had to customize pagination JS.

2. What did you like and what did you enjoy less?
	
	More: setting API, ajax, javascript handling of results. Less: working with CSS, embellishment.

3. Are you ready to work on the features and services end-to-end by taking them all the way from the backend to the product’s website? Would you be happy to work that way? 

	Sure, I'm ready. I'm more happy to work with Python, back-end part, JS. The only thing I don't like is working on serious styling.

4. Are there any specific knowledge areas or application layers where you would like to stay focused on? Are there any specific ingredients that must present in your work in order to make you happy?

	Machine Learning, AI, Python in general. Ability to work with the latest, edge technologies. Everyone today can create a site, but just few are connected with the innovative solutions.

5. If you are not happy with working on the web, would you be ready to develop at least prototype-quality web interface for your features?

	Sure, I can't say I'm not happy with the web, actually I had a lot of fun doing this task.

6. Would you be ready to periodically switch the context to work on internal tools and other micro-projects? For example, would it be OK to ask you to take a break from your work on the main product and develop a tool providing data insights on a stock market?

	If it is connected to stock market predictions then definitely. In general, it is ok to switch to micro-projects, unless it's when I'm hardly working on main task.

7. Sometimes you need to improve the product by making changes on the backend only (example: improving a keyword ranking algorithm) and sometimes your changes are limited to the web interface to improve the data visualization (example: add a new chart). Can you do both? Does it sound good?

	Sure, I can do both. 

8. Will you be ready to work on things like payment handling and user account management? Do you have an experience working on such services? If so - what did you use to build it?

	I don't have such experience, so I can't say if I'm ready. I think, yes.

9. Would it be OK for your to help with admin tasks like configuring and monitoring a web server?

	I have minor experience with admin tasks, bash and servers in general, but if I would be able to help - will.

10. Would you be ready to help the team (especially non-technical members) with the configuration and troubleshooting of different tools and services like a remote desktop connectivity, email aliases and etc?

	If you mean tools which I built then yes, otherwise I'm not sure I'll be happy doing this.

11. Are you interested in analyzing how customers are interacting with your service and features to find new insights leading to the further product improvement?

	Not sure.

12. What do you get a satisfaction from:
	a) Realizing that you’ve solved a challenging technical problem - DEFINITELY
	b) Gained new experience that will make you a better developer - SURE
	c) Watching how the new service you’ve just shipped excites the customers - A BIT
	d) Getting a recognition for your contribution from the colleagues - MAYBE
	e) Finding a feature revealing new patterns in the dataset :) - ESPECIALLY IN STOCK MARKETS xD
	f) Writing an elegant code that you can be proud of (secretly looking at it again and again) - OK
	g) Developing a kick ass UI that will excite the customers and leave the competitors jealous - NOT REALLY
	h) Something else

13) Does any of these product sound interesting to you:
	A niche research service for ecommerce sellers allowing them to reveal the most profitable niches and keywords for launching new products.

	An Advertisement (Ads) management service allowing ecommerce sellers to put their ads on autopilot by using intelligent algorithms for constant optimization of the Ad performance.

	A performance dashboard for the ecommerce sellers allowing them to better analyze and predict sales of their products.

	All products are interconnected and rely on data aggregation and analysis using heuristics and machine learning techniques.

	Each product should become the best in its class by providing the outstanding data insights. An MVP should start with a heuristic and other easy to implement data mining algorithms and in the case of good market reception will progress to more complex machine learning and data analysis models.

		Yes.

14) What is your ideal team and project based on your current interests? What are the key work ingredients that make you happy?

	Curious investigators with a very particular set of skills. Skill they have acquired over a very long career. Skills that help them to find patterns and features in chaotic data.

15) How much value (in percentage) do you put in solving interesting technical problems vs shipping a successful product?

	80 / 20
