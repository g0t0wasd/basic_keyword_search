1. Which implementation (with and without the inverted index) do you think is faster and why?
Inverted implementation works faster. I'm not sure I know why.

2. Can you compare these implementations as an overall number of operations and memory consumption?
Sorry, not yet.

3. Which part of this project did you like and which part you enjoyed less?
I liked application designing and implementing part the most. The less enjoyable part for me was designing tests (probably because I was a bit tired after process of implementation)

4. How much time did it take you?
A bit more than an hour for implementation of main class, half of an hour for designing InvertedSolution and writing test routines.
